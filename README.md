# EntityFluentGenerator
Currently to generate Entity POCO classes using Entity Framework Power Tool is a tough task. It generates entire database schema. No doubt many work arounds are there but Entity Framework POCO generator provide a centralized way to handle POCO generation with best practices.

We need contributors as much as possible. To contribute for this project just email me at manpritsinghsahota@gmail.com.

Currently the application is at initial stage.
